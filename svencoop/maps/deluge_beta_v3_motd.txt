Known bugs (or features) in the 4.8 beta version.
----------------
-This version is like 99% on visleafs limit and i cant add anymore shit into it.
This shows as teleport paths between lots of areas, boarded doors, sort of lack of detail and weird gameplay choices
-Might still be little unbalanced when played alone
-Weapons might sound really weird on the low-def pack, and otherwise
-Lack of variety with NPC models for now, expect alot of clones. Lots of content is going to be later replaced with better ones
-Kick might be underpowered in comparison of the fists, something i couldnt fix no matter what
-Boss characters are sort of dumb
-"Voice acting" doesnt work half the time


Story
------
Swampy substances on concrete foundations

Little more goofier storyline
----------------
This strange swampy substance spread everywhere, making everyone go insane and circling between realities in obscure manner.
Nothing obviously made sense anymore and the swampy substance was forgotten as it is. Entirely new species appeared and
none gave a flying turd of them. Your face is distorted from swampy vapors and your hands grow fungus as thought to yourself:
"Am i still on earth, or some other planet? I dont know anymore, but fuck whatever"

Your small gang of swamped and deteriorated people had a brilliant idea, to start figuring out
what the hell is causing the swamped substances in first place, that was the most sane thought anyone had for long time.
Armed with your makeshift weapons just in case. You then stumble into some odd looking scifi-ish area.
Different colored doors, deadly traps, monsters, keycards. "Oh hold on" you say to yourself.

*Imagine some Duke Nukem or b-movie one-liner here or something*
